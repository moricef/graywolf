// TxSink is implemented by anything that accepts AX.25 frames for
// transmit scheduling. The canonical implementation is *Governor;
// callers that need only to submit frames should depend on this
// interface rather than the concrete type so tests can inject a fake
// without reaching for a package-local interface copy.
//
// Every production call site funnels through txgovernor.Governor.
// Previously each caller (kiss, agw, beacon, igate) declared its own
// TxSink + SubmitSource types duplicating this signature, which meant
// a change to the governor's Submit contract could silently drift
// away from the duplicates until a compile error finally surfaced in
// the adapter layer. Depending on this type eliminates that risk.

// TxHookRegistry is the narrow hook-registration interface. Callers
// that only need to register/unregister a TxHook should depend on
// this interface rather than the concrete *Governor so tests can
